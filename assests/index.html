        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          We love fish! There's few things in the world that make us as happy as
          looking at a cute little fish. It was a dark and dreary October night
          when everything went wrong. My wife and I had just departed on our
          first vacation since we got married. The rain was heavy, the wind was
          strong, and it was incredibly cold. Due to bad traffic, the drive took
          hours. Around two miles from the hotel, our car broke down. Our
          insurance said it would take at least three hours for a tow truck to
          get to us, so we just decided to just walk the rest of the way to the
          hotel. When we finally arrived, there was an issue with our
          reservation, so our room was downgraded. We were cold. We were tired.
          We needed a breath. The rain began to let up as we walked towards the
          beach to just get a lung-full of that salty, salty ocean air. As we
          reached the beach and sat in the sand, my foot brushed up against
          something soft. As I looked at it, I saw it was fish, washed up on the
          beach. And we smiled.

          <h2>Our Promise to You</h2>
          <p>
            Do you love fish? If you've come this far, I think it's safe to assume that you do. And if you're like us (which we've already established that you are), then nothing makes you smile more than an adorable little fish. Our goal is to, on a bi-monthly basis, send you a fish in the mail.
