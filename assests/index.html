            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We love fish! There's few things in the world that make us as happy as looking at a cute little fish. It was a dark and dreary October night when everything went wrong. My wife and I had just departed on our first vacation since we got married. The rain was heavy, the wind was strong, and it was incredibly cold. Due to bad traffic, the drive took hours. Around two miles from the hotel, our car broke down. Our insurance said it would take at least three hours for a tow truck to get to us, so we just decided to just walk the rest of the way to the hotel. When we finally arrived, there was an issue with our reservation, so our room was downgraded. We were cold. We were tired. We needed a breath. The rain began to let up as we walked towards the beach to just get a lung-full of that salty, salty ocean air. </p>
